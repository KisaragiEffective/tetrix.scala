day 9
-----

Yesterday we got the tetrix-solving agent to play a better game by fixing the heuristic function and evaluating 36 possible positions of the current piece.

### stop watch

Let's start by creating a function to measure the time it takes to run a segment of code:

```scala
  private[this] def stopWatch[A](name: String)(arg: => A): A = {
    val t0 = System.currentTimeMillis
    val retval: A = arg
    val t1 = System.currentTimeMillis
    println(name + " took " + (t1 - t0).toString + " ms")
    retval
  }
```

This can be called as follows:

```scala
    stopWatch("bestMove") {
      // do something
    } // stopWatch
```

This outputs as follows:

```
[info] Running com.tetrix.swing.Main 
[info] bestMove took 84 ms
[info] selected List(MoveLeft, MoveLeft, MoveLeft, MoveLeft) -0.3
[info] bestMove took 43 ms
[info] selected List(MoveLeft, MoveLeft, MoveLeft) -0.3
[info] bestMove took 24 ms
[info] selected List(MoveLeft, MoveLeft) -0.3
[info] bestMove took 22 ms
[info] selected List(MoveLeft) -0.3
[info] bestMove took 26 ms
[info] selected List() -0.3
[info] bestMove took 17 ms
[info] selected List() -0.3
[info] bestMove took 10 ms
[info] selected List() -0.3
[info] bestMove took 8 ms
[info] selected List() -0.3
[info] bestMove took 11 ms
[info] selected List() -0.3
[info] bestMove took 13 ms
[info] selected List() -0.3
```

There's the initial wind down as JIT compiler kicks in, and it eventually settles around 10 ms. This gives us roughly what kind of time frame we are dealing with.
