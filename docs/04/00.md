day 4
-----

In the last few days, we implemented tetrix from the ground up. In the beginning I mentioned that I use this game to explore new ways of thinking. Since I had already implemented tetrix once in Scala, Scala alone really isn't anything new for me. The actual topic I wanted to think about using tetrix is the handling of concurrency.
