Yesterday, we approximated the game state using `String`. Let's see how we can improve this.

### modeling the game

On screen there should be a 10x20 grid. I only want the current piece to be rendered in different color. We'll deal with the next piece window later. The different kinds of pieces can be represented using case objects:

```scala
sealed trait PieceKind
case object IKind extends PieceKind
case object JKind extends PieceKind
case object LKind extends PieceKind
case object OKind extends PieceKind
case object SKind extends PieceKind
case object TKind extends PieceKind
case object ZKind extends PieceKind
```

Individual blocks can be represented using a case class:

```scala
case class Block(pos: (Int, Int), kind: PieceKind)
```

Both the current piece and the grid can be presented using `Seq[Block]`.

```scala
case class GameView(blocks: Seq[Block], gridSize: (Int, Int), current: Seq[Block])
```

Now we can change the `AbstractUI` to return an instance of `GameView`.

```scala
  def view: GameView =
    GameView(
      Seq(Block((5, 5), TKind), Block((6, 5), TKind), Block((7, 5), TKind), Block((6, 6), TKind), Block((0, 0), TKind)),
      (10, 20),
      Seq(Block((5, 5), TKind), Block((6, 5), TKind), Block((7, 5), TKind), Block((6, 6), TKind)))
```
