day 3

Today's goal is to finish up the basic feature of Tetrix so it's playable.

### REPL

A few people in the community is coming up with best practices in Scala.

- [Effective Scala][wall] talk at Scala Days 2011 by Bill Venners and Dick Wall
- [Effective Scala][suereth] talk at NEScala 2012 by Josh Suereth 
- [Scala in Depth][suereth2] book by Josh Suereth 
- [Effective Scala][eriksen] page by Marius Eriksen at Twitter

As you would expect all of them mention to "Favor Immutability" and "Use None instead of null" like [Programming in Scala][pins] book. Some of the notable ones are "Know Your Collections" and "Consider Always Providing Return Types on Functions and Methods" by Venners/Wall, and more recently "Experiment in the REPL" by Josh.

> Experiment-driven development is where you, the developer, first spend some time experimenting with a live interpreter or REPL before writing tests or production code.

From the sbt shell, you can run `console` to get into the RELP which automatically loads your code into the classpath. Let's try to create the setup for clearing the bottom row:

```scala
