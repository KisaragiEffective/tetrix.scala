day 8
-----

Yesterday we hooked up our tetrix-solving agent to an actor to take control of the game. Thus far the way it handled the game looked neither rational nor intelligent. After seeing many of the moves evaluated to 0.0 score including the heuristic penalties, I had two sneaking suspicions.

First, `Drop` was never a good choice. Especially given the shallow search tree, selecting `Drop` seemed premature. Since the gravitational tick is going to take care of the downard movement anyway, I decided to ignore it when the agent thinks the best move is `Drop`:

```scala
  def receive = {
    case BestMove(s: GameState) =>
      val message = agent.bestMove(s)
      if (message != Drop) stageActor ! message
  }
```
